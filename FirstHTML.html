                            <font size="25">It is a truth universally acknowledged,</font>
                            that a single man in possession
                            of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
                            However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be
                            on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the
                            minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful
                            property of some one or other of their daughters.
                            <P>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you
                                heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”</P>
                            <P>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</P>
                            <P>“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
                                told me all about it.”</P>
                            <P>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</P>
                            <P>“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.
                                <P> “You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
                                    <P>This was invitation enough.</P>
